First paragraph describing Brian Bauska.  I'm working on writing and publishing over 100 web sites.  Many clones of one another with little tweeks.

About me: Brian Bauska 341 S Madison  Monroe, WA 98272  509.306.0375  brianbauska@gmail.com

I work for the USPS in Monroe, WA as a Rural Carrier Assistant.  Currently subbing for Rural Route #9 Kendra's route.  I'd like to add the capabilities of programming the route with special instructions and/or photos.  For example, if you needed to know a combination or if an Arrow key is required to access the mailbox. 

Many rural route patrons have special requirements.  This site I'm working on will address these requirements, with both text & images.
