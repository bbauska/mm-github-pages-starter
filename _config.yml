# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  In the beginning, many things became one.  Then google stole all 
  that is holy and made billions upon billions doing it.  Next, 
  Amazon and Facebook came along and showed Google what greed really
  looks like.
  How to manipulate and election and con your political party.
  You can edit this line in _config.yml. It will appear in your 
  document head meta (for Google search results) and in your feed.xml
